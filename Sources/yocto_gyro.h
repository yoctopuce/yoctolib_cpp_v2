 * Retrieves a gyroscope for a given identifier.

 * <li>ModuleSerialNumber.FunctionIdentifier</li>
 * <li>ModuleSerialNumber.FunctionLogicalName</li>
 * <li>ModuleLogicalName.FunctionIdentifier</li>

 * This function does not require that the gyroscope is online at the time
 * it is invoked. The returned object is nevertheless valid.
 * Use the method isOnline() to test if the gyroscope is
 * indeed online at a given time. In case of ambiguity when looking for
 * a gyroscope by logical name, no error is notified: the first instance
 * found is returned. The search is performed first by hardware name,
 * then by logical name.
 *
 * If a call to this object's is_online() method returns FALSE although
 * you are certain that the matching device is plugged, make sure that you did
 * call registerHub() at application initialization time.
 *
 * @param func : a string that uniquely characterizes the gyroscope, for instance
 *         Y3DMK002.gyro.
